Greetings! Thank you for choosing Machine Manager as your sweets controller firmware.

To configure Machine Manager you must edit Configuration.h and Configuration_adv.h
located in the root 'MachineManager' folder. Check our Configurations repository to
see if there's a more suitable starting-point for your specific hardware.


================================================================================

The system comes prepared with a Watchdog function. It makes the system reboot in
case it does not send a feed in about 3.2 seconds. It is useful for situations where
the code might get stuck in a loop.
