 * Thermocouple sensors are quite sensitive to noise.  Any noise induced in
 * the sensor wires, such as by stepper motor wires run in parallel to them,
 * may result in the thermocouple sensor reporting spurious errors.  This
 * value is the number of errors which can occur in a row before the error
 * is reported.  This allows us to ignore intermittent error conditions while
 * still detecting an actual failure, which should result in a continuous
 * stream of errors from the sensor.
 *
 * Set this value to 0 to fail on the first error to occur.
